[![BUILD](https://img.shields.io/github/actions/workflow/status/Mango420x/MOLS/ci.yml?branch=main&label=build&style=for-the-badge)](https://github.com/Mango420x/MOLS/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

MOLS is a logistics app to manage warehouses, resources, stock, orders and shipments, with an audit log (movements) so you can trace what changed and why.

---

## Highlights

- Stock adjustments automatically create Movement audit records (`ENTRY` / `EXIT`)
- Orders with items (create/edit, inline item management)
- Shipments with fulfillment on delivery
- Traceability views (Order/Shipment details show linked movements)
- `/ui` dashboard with KPIs, charts (Chart.js), recent activity and alerts
- First-run setup to create the initial admin user
- Admin-only user management (roles, password reset, enable/disable)

## Dashboard (UI)

The dashboard at `/ui` shows sensible empty states on a fresh database, and becomes more useful as you build history.

Includes:

- KPI cards: total orders (with pending), stock quantity across warehouses, active shipments, low-stock alerts, recent movements (24h), fulfillment rate
- Charts: stock distribution by warehouse (bar), movements by type (doughnut), orders by status (pie)
- Alerts: low stock items (action link to adjust), stale pending orders (link to order detail)

Dashboard thresholds live in `src/main/resources/application.properties`:

- `mols.dashboard.low-stock-threshold` (default: 10)
- `mols.dashboard.critical-stock-threshold` (default: 5)
- `mols.dashboard.stale-order-days` (default: 3)
- `mols.dashboard.recent-activity-hours` (default: 24)
- `mols.dashboard.movement-chart-days` (default: 30)
- `mols.dashboard.fulfillment-target-percent` (default: 90)
